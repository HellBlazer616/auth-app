## A. Cloud Kitchen

Cloud kitchens or ghost kitchens do not have a brick and mortar presence. Rather they take orders online and employ delivery systems to send their foods to customers. They can be single or multi-branded, operate independently, work under-delivery app owned working space, or even under a traditional restaurant. Some of them even have a storefront.

Now based on the type of cloud kitchen their tech stack changes. Some cloud kitchens do not even need a tech stack as they work for a food delivery company like uber eats or Deliveroo. But single or multi-branded cloud kitchens do need a tech stack as they work independently. So the discussion below will be focused on these kitchens.

## B. Tech Stack

### Taking Orders

This is a vital part of cloud kitchens as they rely solely on online order for business. The order can come in from the kitchen's website or from an app. The app needs to be intuitive and need to showcase the kitchen and its menu. Also if the app is made by the kitchen, it is necessary to add some extra features like, reviews, promotion etc to the app. So, the kitchen needs a web site and cross-platform apps. They can hand it off to an order managing service.

### Managing Orders

Order can come in from the kitchen's own app or from some food delivery app. They need to be processed immediately a passed down to the kitchen crew. As they come in from different sources they need to be managed centrally. After the kitchen crew is done with an order it has to be handed down to the drivers who will deliver the food. So it needs a database and a back end service that can handle the order and track it through its various state. If the kitchen offers live tracking then the service has to accommodate sending regular updates to the customer.

### Handling Payment

Payments can be handled when taking the order or while delivering orders. Third party solutions like credit card, Paypal integration will be needed. And because of the nature of this it needs to be very secured. So, another potential service that will integrate these features to the app and order service.

### Suppliers

A kitchen needs to track all its supplier transactions and data. So, another database and service o manage that.

### Staffing

Staff information needs to be stored and maintained efficiently. If the kitchen employs gig-based workers it needs to be fairly robust to keep track of it all.

### Inventory

For maximizing profit the inventory need to be managed by database and backend service. If the kitchen is multi-branded the inventory need to be centralized.

### Data Crunching

The kitchen needs to track all the incoming data and find out the patterns and numbers about the business. Like when a food item is most likely to be ordered. This will make sure that the kitchen runs efficiently. So another service on the back end that can do all these data crunchings.

### Tying Them Together

And most importantly all these services need to be tied together.

So a robust cloud kitchen wil need multiple services that can have their own micro services. And a potential multiple databases and client facing site and cross platform app. And a centralized monitoring system that connects them all. So a tech stack will be micro service based, will use multiple databases, a centralized monitoring system and potentially server less functions.
